00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
Welcome, Frankie.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.720
Great to be here, very excited.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.080
We have sort of met.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.580
Yeah.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.420
In passing.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.960
Kind of.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.682
Not in a jaunty
little wooden trail.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:08.390
Not in the woods.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.590
No.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.690
CBS, Radford, all
over the place.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.190
Different places, the Emmys.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.390
Yeah, you did a great job.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.100
And thank you, and
you do a great job

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.790
on Malcolm in the Middle.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.390
You're so great.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.140
Thank you so much.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.560
It's a very good show.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.060
Thank you.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.820
Good job.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.320
Now--

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.870
All right, I watched--

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.660
you know, have you been
watching Punk'd, the MTV

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.220
show that Ashton Kuthcer--

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.980
if you don't know what Punk'd
is, it's candid camera.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.053
It's an evil, evil
candid camera.

00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:39.970
There's nothing funny.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.650
It's not a talking mailbox.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.920
It's Ashton Kutcher doing
some mean things to people,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.710
and then it's, oh,
you've been punked.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.850
And they punked you.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.360
Yes.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.850
And I thought you
handled it so well,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.140
because they took your car.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.910
Yeah, they took one of my cars.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.940
And my cars are
my life, you know?

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.940
That's all I care about.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.650
And, you know, I
seriously thought

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.570
I was going for a
meeting to learn.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.250
You know, they were going to
tell me about this movie idea

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.833
that they had.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.643
And I go out, and
my car is gone.

00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:07.810
And you know, they cut it
down to like five minutes.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.100
But I was actually really
cool for the first 45

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.560
minutes outside, until I
talked to the guy on the phone.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.560
Because I left my phone
in the car accidentally.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.060
Right.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.940
And then I cursed for the first
time on TV to the valet guy.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.200
It was very exciting.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.100
Yeah.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.157
Well, it's a very nice
car, and I wouldn't even

00:01:25.157 --> 00:01:26.990
give it to a valet if
I had a car like that.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.150
Normally, I didn't, but I
was, like, 30 minutes late.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.490
So it was just kind of like,
you know, rush and get in.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.980
And it was just so weird.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.730
But now when I think
back at it, you know,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.110
people were asking
me what kind of car

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.390
I was driving that day, like
my managers who set it up

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.200
and everything like that.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.850
And, you know, I didn't
think anything of it.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.660
You know, I was
just like, oh yeah,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.505
I'm in my Porsche,
but no big deal.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:44.630
And got there, and it was--

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.505
Now, are you going to--
because sometimes you

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:47.270
punk other people.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.770
Are you going to
punk somebody else?

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.940
I am punking people.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.772
I can't say who.

00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:51.980
Have you already punked them?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.397
No, but very soon.

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:55.730
I think this weekend or next
weekend I'm going to do it.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.300
Really?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.800
Yeah.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.620
Who is it?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.420
I can't say.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.312
I don't know.

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:01.520
It's going to be fun, though.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.930
I mean, it's going to be scary.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.920
But we'll see what happens.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.837
Yeah, I can't imagine.

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:05.690
I'm scared to death.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.050
I hope they never, ever do that
to me, because I'll just cry.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.820
It'll just be me.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.560
Whatever they, do I'll just cry.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.040
I know that.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.050
I don't know, it's fun.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.410
Really?

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.630
It's funny, because out of
all the things I've done,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.990
the show--

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.698
I've been on the show
for five years now,

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:21.050
Cody Banks, Big Fat Liar.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.410
I've never been recognized for
something more than Punk'd.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.420
Everyone's like, oh,
you were on Punk'd.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.830
I don't know who you are,
but you were on Punk'd.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.038
That's such an awesome thing.

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:29.660
Yeah.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.638
It's a popular show.

00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:31.430
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.030
It really is.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.530
Now, you really are.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.450
I was kidding about how
old you are, but you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.575
just-- how old are you now?

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm turning 18 in 2 weeks.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.290
Really?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.790
Yeah.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.032
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.670
And you got-- you just moved
out of your mom's house?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.400
Yeah, and I live in
my own house now.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.910
Really?

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.740
Is it a big house?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.610
It's pretty big.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.050
Yeah?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.890
I don't know.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.730
Are you going to be on Cribs?

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.605
Are you going to show
us your house on Cribs?

00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:58.260
I want to.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.760
Yeah?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.130
It's weird, because, you know,
I've been there for four months

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.630
now.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.740
And I was so excited
when I first moved in,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.390
and I was going, and I decorated
the whole thing on my own.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.190
It was awesome.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.940
And now, I still have boxes and
just stuff all over the place.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.780
And I want to go
through it, and I just--

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.340
you know, I start and two
minutes later I'm done.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.840
Oh, so you're not
like a neat freak.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.340
You're not--

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.840
Well, I am.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.757
But that's why I'm just
keeping it in the box,

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:22.010
because it's neat in there.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.430
Yeah.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.300
I see.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.530
That's your version of neat.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.180
It's in a box.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.530
It not anywhere on the floor.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.460
It's cool.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.215
And you have-- like,
I love animals.

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:33.090
Everybody knows that.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.610
You have a lot of animals.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.110
Yeah.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.818
What do you have?

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:39.330
I have a dog, which I
just adopted a month ago.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.450
I have a sphynx, which
is a hairless cat.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.830
I have four rats, five
leopard geckos, a millipede.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.460
I'm really bad.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.043
Whenever I go to
Petco or a pet store,

00:03:49.043 --> 00:03:50.520
I come out with something.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.750
Wait a minute.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.790
You have a cat and four rats?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.690
Yes.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.070
Yeah.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.010
How long will that last?

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.450
Well, you know,
it's been a while.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.468
Do they see each other?

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:03.510
Yeah, whenever I go in
the room, I open the door,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.170
and the cat goes in there.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.120
But the cats really
just like-- you know,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.578
I don't think would
ever hurt them.

00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:09.630
But one of my rats got out.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.940
Oh.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.370
Yes, it will.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.910
One of my rats got out, and
it was missing for two weeks.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.529
And it ended up--

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.750
I found it, and it was
fine, and it's perfect now,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.930
and the cat didn't touch it.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.668
And it's cool.

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:25.210
You probably just
found a regular rat

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.720
and added it to your rats.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.460
It wasn't the same rat.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.300
And you have a very
special dog, too, right?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.800
Yes.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.425
What's the dog?

00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:34.560
I adopted a dog from
the Bill Foundation.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.120
And he is an amazing pit bull,
but the sweetest, sweetest dog

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.720
in the world.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.320
I adopted him.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.590
He's missing an eye, and he was
abused, and he was really hurt.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.042
But he's the best dog ever.

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:45.750
And he's awesome.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.960
That's great.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.460
And it's called the
Bill Foundation?

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.100
Yeah, it's Beverly hills
nonprofit organization

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.980
that comes, and they
take in 60 dogs at a time

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.840
and train them
and work with them

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.640
with people and cats
and other animals.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.070
Yeah, there are pit bulls
that are really sweet dogs.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.760
Awesome dogs.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.510
That's great that you did that.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.680
You got a one-eyed dog.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.380
Yeah.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.610
That's very sweet.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.900
And a millipede-- I'm sure
that's an affectionate pet.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.400
Yeah.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.500
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.930
All right, Malcolm in the
Middle is on Sunday nights

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.733
at 9:00 on Fox.

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:15.900
We'll be right back with
Jeff Cosgrove and his three

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.710
final bachelorettes.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.280
Thank you, Frankie.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.880
Thank you.
